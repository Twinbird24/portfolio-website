	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p><span>Hey!</span> my name is Attila and I'm a web developer. Ever since I was a child I have been interested in technology — I built my first desktop when I was only 11 years old. Eventually, I became so good at fixing computer issues that I started my own small home business fixing PCs for neighbours! I got my first taste of development and design when I started playing around with Flash and Actionscript in grade school and early highschool. I created a lot of cool animations as well as a few Flash games. However, come time for matriculation, I decided to study biology. After 5 years of study, I realized biology is a field I did not want to pursue as a career, and here I am today working on what I truly enjoy — transforming coffee into creative web applications.<br><br>
	As a developer, I'm constantly learning new technologies and looking for ways to challenge myself and expand my horizon. Feel free to browse through some of the things I've created (or currently working on) in my portfolio, or click on the links below in the footer to check out my other online profiles, and don't hesitate to send me a message if you'd like to grab some beers or just have a chat!</p>

		<h3>Web Design &amp; Development</h3>
		<p>Need a new website for your rock collection? I love designing unique websites and developing interactive applications. Whether it's a simple static website or a full-stack project&mdash;using my professional knowledge of front-end and back-end technologies, I'm happy to craft an idea into a masterpiece. I'll even make it work in Internet Explorer (if I really have to).</p>
	</div>

		<div id="icon_holder"><i class="fa fa-check-circle-o fa-5x" aria-hidden="true"></i></div>
		<h3>Up to Date</h3>
		<p>Web development is a very dynamic field, not only are there at least a billion jQuery plugins and JavaScript libraries, but there's also a lot of different types of coffee I can drink. Choosing the right tools and the right coffee is very important. I am constantly learning, whether by networking with fellow developers, reading a new book, or enrolled in a course online.</p>

		<h3>Creative &amp; Enthusiastic</h3>
		<p>Coding is fun! That's the entire reason I'm here&mdash;in fact, you'll often find me on Codewars taking on new coding challenges, or on Reddit reading about cool things going on in the world of web development. Being excited about web development isn't the only thing that keeps me alive, it's the creativity&mdash;being able to turn any idea into reality, and I'm always thinking of new ideas that I can bring to life.</p>
